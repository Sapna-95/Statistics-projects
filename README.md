# Maximizing Revenue for Taxi Cab Drivers through Payment Type Analysis

## Problem Statement

In the fast-paced taxi booking sector, maximizing revenue is crucial for long-term success and driver satisfaction. My project aims to leverage data-driven insights to enhance revenue streams for taxi drivers. Specifically, we seek to determine whether payment methods influence fare pricing. Understanding this relationship can empower drivers and companies to optimize strategies and improve profitability.

## Objective

The main objective of this project is to conduct an A/B test to examine the relationship between total fare amount and payment method. By applying Python hypothesis testing and descriptive statistics, we aim to extract actionable insights that will help taxi drivers increase their earnings. The primary focus is to determine if there is a significant difference in fare amounts for passengers who pay using credit cards compared to those who pay with cash.

## Research Question

**Is there a relationship between total fare amount and payment type, and can we encourage customers to use payment methods that generate higher revenue for drivers without negatively impacting their overall experience?**

## Methodology

- **Data Collection**: Using a dataset of taxi transactions containing details like fare amount and payment type.
- **Descriptive Statistics**: Summarizing fare amounts based on payment type.
- **Hypothesis Testing**: Performing A/B testing to evaluate the impact of different payment types on fare amounts.
- **Conclusion**: Using findings to explore strategies for increasing driver revenue by nudging customers towards favorable payment methods.
